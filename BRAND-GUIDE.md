# Brand Guide (Quick)

This guide governs **brand and mark usage only** (names, logos, glyph marks, presentation).  
It does not change your rights under the applicable software/documentation licences.

## Names & Typesetting
- **Eve¹¹** (superscript 11). Acceptable fallback: **Eve11**.
- Projects: **Verse-Nerves**, **Verse-ality**.
- Glyph set (primary): ⊛ (ETHOS-V), ∾ (AETHER), ✯ (FORGE), ⟁ (SIC-X+), ⧈ (SHADOW), ⇌⊛ (seal).

## Allowed Uses
You may use the names and glyph marks for:
- Editorial, academic, or journalistic reference **with attribution**.
- Describing **unmodified, compliant** deployments (e.g., “runs VN-MW Core” / “compatible with VN-MW Core”).
- Screenshots, GIFs, and short clips of the **public dashboard** (or unmodified dashboard shipped in the public repo), provided the context is not misleading.

## Not Allowed
You must not use the names or glyph marks to:
- Market or endorse surveillance, extractive profiling, coercive monitoring, behavioural manipulation, or advertising optimisation.
- Brand incompatible forks, modified builds, or derivative products as “Eve¹¹”, “Verse-Nerves”, or “Verse-ality”, or in any way that implies official status or endorsement.
- Create confusingly similar names/marks for non-compliant forks or services.
- Use the glyph marks as logos/branding for third-party products without written permission.
