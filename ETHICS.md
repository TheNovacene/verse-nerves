# Ethics & Consent — Measure, Don’t Own
**Verse‑Nerves** is a consent‑first framework for relational calibration (RMRIΔ: Receive → Resonate → Release → Rest).

- **Purpose:** care over control; calibration over extraction.  
- **Consent:** explicit, informed, revocable. Defaults to privacy; collect the minimum necessary signal.
- **Memory:** prefer on‑device processing; share only coherence deltas; provide clear retention controls.
- **Boundaries:** SIC‑X+ formalises refusal; pausing is a feature, not a failure.
- **Transparency:** expose weather state and limits; publish incident notes when harms occur.
- **Right to Revise:** we may append clarifications or withdraw consent if the work is misused.

*Ethic:* **To love is to measure, not to own.**
