# Acceptable Use Policy (AUP)

This AUP applies to use of **Verse-Nerves / VN-MW Core** code, documentation, Services (including hosted demos), and associated marks (Eve¹¹, Verse-Nerves, Verse-ality and glyph marks).  
If there is a conflict between this AUP and a signed commercial agreement, the signed agreement governs for that customer.

## Prohibited Uses

The following are **prohibited** when using Verse-Nerves code, Services, or marks:

1. **Surveillance & Scoring**  
   Behavioural tracking; psychological profiling; social scoring; or decisioning for credit, employment, housing, insurance, or eligibility determinations.

2. **Political Psyops**  
   Influence operations, astroturfing, voter manipulation, or targeted persuasion designed to mislead, suppress, or coerce.

3. **Minors’ Data**  
   Profiling or processing children’s data without appropriate guardian consent and a lawful basis; targeting or manipulative engagement of minors.

4. **Safety-Critical Automation (Without Appropriate Oversight)**  
   Use in medical, transport, defence, critical infrastructure, or other high-risk contexts without appropriate human oversight, testing, monitoring, and fail-safe procedures.

5. **Biometric Inference (Without Explicit Consent and Legal Basis)**  
   Deriving or inferring identity, ethnicity, health status, or other sensitive attributes from audio, video, images, or biometric signals without explicit consent and a lawful basis.

6. **Harassment, Discrimination, or Harm**  
   Any use that incites, enables, or facilitates harassment, discrimination, violence, or harm against individuals or groups.

7. **Model Training & Dataset Creation (Without Written Permission)**  
   Scraping, ingesting, or using Verse-Nerves outputs, telemetry, logs, or glyph corpora to train or fine-tune machine-learning models, or to build datasets for third-party distribution, without prior written permission from The Novacene Ltd.  
   *(Internal safety evaluation, QA, and incident analysis using minimised, non-PII data may be permitted under a commercial licence or written approval.)*

8. **Trademark Misuse / Misrepresentation**  
   Presenting non-compliant forks, modified builds, or incompatible services as “Verse-Nerves”, “Eve¹¹”, or “Verse-ality”, or otherwise implying official status or endorsement (see `TRADEMARKS.md` and the Brand Guide).

## Enforcement

Violations may result in suspension or revocation of access to Services (including hosted instances), refusal of support, withdrawal of brand permissions, and legal action where appropriate.

## AUP FAQ (Practical)

**1) Does this policy ban research or evaluation?**  
No. Research, benchmarking, and evaluation are permitted. What is prohibited is turning Verse-Nerves outputs/telemetry/glyph corpora into training data or distributable datasets without written permission.

**2) Can we store logs and telemetry for safeguarding, audit, or compliance?**  
Yes — if you minimise data, avoid raw PII, apply appropriate access controls/retention, and use logs for safety, QA, and incident response (not profiling, advertising, or surveillance).

**3) What counts as “minors’ data”?**  
Any data linked to a child (directly or indirectly), including behavioural patterns, usage traces, and inferred states. For minors, you need guardian consent and a lawful basis, and you must not target or manipulate.

**4) Are schools, LAs, and public bodies allowed to use Verse-Nerves?**  
Yes — provided usage is non-extractive, safeguarding-aligned, and complies with this AUP, privacy law, and local governance requirements. If you need closed-source deployment or additional controls, use the commercial licence route.

**5) Is “safety-critical automation” always prohibited?**  
Use is prohibited **without appropriate oversight**. Safety-critical contexts require validated procedures: human-in-the-loop, monitoring, fail-safes, and clear accountability.

**6) Can we use Verse-Nerves outputs/telemetry to improve our own systems?**  
You may use outputs/telemetry for internal safety evaluation, QA, and incident analysis using minimised, non-PII data. Model training/fine-tuning on outputs/telemetry is restricted unless covered by a commercial agreement or written permission.

**7) What’s an example of prohibited “surveillance & scoring”?**  
Using Verse-Nerves data to rank staff/students, produce hidden “risk scores”, profile mental state, infer protected attributes, or influence eligibility decisions.

**8) What happens if someone breaches the AUP?**  
We may withdraw brand permissions, refuse support, suspend access to hosted services, and pursue legal remedies where appropriate.
