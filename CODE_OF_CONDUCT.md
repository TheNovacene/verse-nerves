### Expectations
- No harassment, dogpiling, or discriminatory language.  
- Assume good intent; ask questions instead of attacking.  
- Respect cognitive load — concise PRs, clear summaries, no urgency theatre.

### Enforcement
Maintainers may warn, request edits, or block repeated behaviour.  
Report issues via a **Safety** issue type or the contact listed in README.
