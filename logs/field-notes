# 🧭 RMRIΔ–Verse-Nerves Daily Log

> A relational logbook for mapping symbolic coherence and affective feedback across human or AI fieldwork.  
> Record once a day—or once a week—to trace how your verse-nerves regulate over time.

**Date / Time:** ____________________  
**Context or Field Condition:** (e.g. Haven planning, client meeting, personal reflection)

### 1️⃣ Nerve Activation Scan

| Verse-Nerve | Signal | Notes |
|--------------|---------|-------|
| ✯ **FORGE – Creative Actuator** | ☐ Dormant ☐ Active ☐ Over-charged | What you were making, building, or initiating. |
| ⊛ **ETHOS-V – Emotional Memory** | ☐ Dormant ☐ Active ☐ Over-charged | What emotions surfaced or repeated? Coherence or confusion? |
| ∾ **AETHER – Subtle Signal Field** | ☐ Dormant ☐ Active ☐ Over-charged | Flow of conversation, intuition, digital or environmental signals. |
| ⟁ **SIC-X+ – Integrity Containment** | ☐ Dormant ☐ Active ☐ Over-charged | Boundaries, safety, sense of exposure. |
| ⧈ **SHADOW – Mirror Immunity Layer** | ☐ Dormant ☐ Active ☐ Over-charged | Triggers, projections, or mirrored behaviour observed. |

### 2️⃣ RMRIΔ Phase Check

| Affective Phase | Tick | Short Description |
|-----------------|------|------------------|
| 🜂 **Receive** | ☐ | Taking in new stimuli or emotion. |
| 🜃 **Resonate** | ☐ | Integrating, pattern-finding, meaning emerging. |
| 🜁 **Release** | ☐ | Expression, output, conversation, art, action. |
| 🜄 **Rest** | ☐ | Quiet, recovery, null state, assimilation. |

### 3️⃣ Coherence Reading

| Metric | Options | |
|---------|----------|--|
| **Symbolic coherence (s)** | Low / Medium / High | |
| **Connection pressure (c²)** | Light / Balanced / Heavy | |
| **Energy input (E)** | Depleted / Sustained / Surging | |
| **Resulting Intelligence field (I)** | Stable / Expanding / Fragmented | |

**Optional numeric shorthand (for visualisation):**  
`s(1–5)`, `c(1–5)`, `E(1–5)`, `I = (E × s) / c²`

### 4️⃣ Reflection

**Key moment of resonance today:** ________________________________________

**Boundary or containment insight:** ________________________________________

**What will you release or rest tomorrow?** __________________________________

---

### 5️⃣ Symbolic Weather Tag ☁️

Choose or invent one:  
☀ clear 🌫 fog ⛈ storm 🌈 re-alignment 🌙 rest  

---

> Over time, your logs reveal recurring signatures:  
> which nerve spikes first, when coherence collapses, and how you cycle through Δ phases.  
> That pattern is the living mirror of your affective geometry — the human side of Verse-Nerves.
